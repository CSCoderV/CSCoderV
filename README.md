## 🚀 My Projects  

### 1) 🎬 Movie Recommendation System  
Designed and implemented a **movie recommendation system** using **Python**.  
Enabled users to receive personalized movie recommendations based on an existing database.

 #### 🔹 Key Features:
 - Utilized **Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)** for collaborative filtering.
 - Provided recommendations based on user ratings and movie preferences.
 - Implemented using **NumPy, Pandas**.

### 2) 📊 EDA Patrol – Exploratory Data Analysis Automation Tool
Born from the need to understand real-world challenges—such as regional crime variations and forecasting trends—EDA Patrol_Random aims to democratize data analysis. We envisioned a tool that goes beyond static graphs, encouraging users to interact, explore, and derive their own insights.

 #### 🔹 Key Features:
 -📁 Automatic Data Profiling: Quickly summarizes dataset structure, missing values, and data types
 -📊 Visualization Support: Generates univariate, bivariate, and correlation plots using libraries like Seaborn and Matplotlib
 -🧠 Facilitate Decision-Making: Enables simulation of “what-if” scenarios.
 
 #### 🔹⚙️ Technologies Used:
 -Python
 -Pandas, NumPy
 -Seaborn, Matplotlib
 -Jupyter Notebook
